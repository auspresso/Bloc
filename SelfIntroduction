#Introduction#

Hello Sharon! I just wanted to give you a *quick* introduction about myself. I joined Bloc after a year long search of the road I wanted to pursue. I have owned a few small companies and worked on business operations for some companies like **1-800 Contacts** and **Qualtrics** and I really enjoy problem solving, but I also really like creative work, which I found lacking in most of my positions. After some self reflection, I discovered I have always had a fascination with design, whether it was conscious or sub conscious, so I have been dipping my toe in the design world for a few months and discovered Bloc during my research.
 
<font size="3" color="red">It seems to be the most comprehensive program outside of a four year degree to break into the field, which is why I decided to take the leap. </font>



The most valuable lesson I have learned in my life is to never let obstacles get in the way of what your passionate about. I started a touring death metal band when I was 15 that ended up making it big despite our knowledge of the music industry. I started a coffee roasting company with no previous experience in the coffee world and got a degree in Economics despite the fact I was terrible at math most of my life. Diving into UX design is definitely going to be a challenge, but I am definitely looking forward to the journey. As Seneca said: 
> Difficulties strengthen the mind,
>  as labor does the body.

To conclude, I wanted to provide a list of what I hope to accomplish during the program.
* Become competent in the basics of visual design.
* Become competent in front end.
* Become confident in my skills as a designer, enough so that I feel prepared to apply for entry level design jobs.

If you have any questions for my end, please let me know. Looking forward to the journey ahead!

-Austin
